# Education Background

* 2023 ~ 2025, Master of Science in Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University

* 2018 ~ 2022, Bachelor of Science in Statistics, School of Statistic, East China Normal University


# Research Experience

Since August 2022, I have been engaged in a remote role as a Statistical Analyst, contributing my expertise to two distinct research teams. I actively participate in the entire lifecycle of research projects, which includes designing study methodologies, selecting appropriate statistical techniques, and interpreting complex data sets. 

## Parkinson Disease

The research team, led by Professor [Ying Chang](https://www.haodf.com/doctor/238861/xinxi-jieshao.html) from the Department of Neurology at China-Japan Union Hospital, has major interest in [Parkinson Disease (PD)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8525-parkinsons-disease-an-overview). From August 2022, I have taken responsibilities in  experimental design, data processing, statistical analysis and visualization. 

As of `r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')`, the team has achieved significant advancements in researching the risk factors associated with non-motor symptoms in patients with PD. We have diligently worked to verify and quantify the relationships between various factors and the occurrence of specific symptoms, like apathy and [impulse control disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25175-impulse-control-disorders) . Ultimately, our efforts have culminated in the development of a predictive model to forecast the onset of these symptoms in PD patients.

## Bone and Joint Surgery

The research team, spearheaded by Professor [Xin Qi](https://m.haodf.com/doctor/78526.html) from the Department of Bone and Joint Surgery at the First Hospital of Jilin University, has made significant advancements in their field. Detailed demonstration of their results can be found on this [websit](http://api.cup-placement.com/) (a little shabby, still working on that). From September 2023, I have shoulder the majority of the analytical and coding responsibilities, including data management, processing, modeling, visualization and website construction.

So far by `r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')`, the team has achieved notable progress in the following areas:

### Total Hip Arthroplasty on Pelvic Mobility

This is a prospective cohort study focusing on the impacts of total hip [arthroplasty](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/arthroplasty) on pelvic mobility. The study centers are The First Hospital of Jilin University and The Sixth Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. The primary objectives of this study are threefold:

* To study changes of pelvic mobility after hip arthroplasty and associated influencing factors in patients with different diagnosis.

* To establish a prediction model for pelvic stiffness remission after hip replacement in patients with DDH.

* To establish a method to screen patients with possible abnormal pelvic mobility based on routine preoperative examinations.


### Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee Classification 

This is a retrospective cohort study focusing on the distribution of coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification among the [osteoarthritis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/arthritis/osteoarthritis) and the healthy population. Particularly focusing on Chinese population, the primary objectives of this study are threefold:

* To investigate the prevalence of CPAK within the Chinese population; to determine if its distribution aligns with formal study.

* To study the impact of OA progression on CPAK classification changes

* To establish a machine learning algorithm for predicting the phenotypic structure of osteoarthritic knee joints.

# Work Experience

*Risk Control Analyst, Shanghai Baigong Network Technology Co., Ltd. (02/2020 - till now)*

* Report monitoring automation: robot based on Python linked database and enterprise WeChat can automatically
broadcast daily business figures, including basic indicators, user portrait indicators and model performance

* Scorecard iteration: developed a scorecard model based on Applist using the LGBM algorithm; integrating it with
models of other dimensions based on logical regression to ensure that the AUC of the final model on OOT was 0.7, KS is 0.24, indicating that the model had strong generalization ability and differentiation gradient; the integration model further optimized the risk exposure and the proportion of bad debts was reduced by 1.5%

* Credit evaluation strategy optimization: optimized the current credit strategy by mining variables and added time slices, trained decision trees to find a better combination of variables and optimized credit leverage

*Delivery Analyst, Acxiom Information Service (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (07/2021-12/2021)*

* Membership loyalty analysis: analyzed the reasons for the low repurchase rate of R3 young consumers by comparing
the loss rate and retention rate of competing products; identified the long-term trend of weak brand stickiness (infidelity) of young consumers; collaborated with the operation department to plan the future operation strategy for such customer groups

* D11 CRM Planning: participated in the CRM planning for Double 11 Shopping Carnival, trained a clustering model based on users’ past purchasing behavior, mind and consumption habits and divided users into nine groups; contributed my parts to reaching 2.45 billion GMV, an increase of 21% over the same period of the previous year
