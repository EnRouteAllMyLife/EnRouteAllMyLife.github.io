ECNU is represented by red, while Columbia boasts blue as its symbol color â€“ such a classical CP! Also, both institutions have lions as their mascots. I prompted ChatGPT to create a few logo fusions. Let's take a look!

# Research Experience

Since August 2022, I have been engaged in a remote role as a Research Assistant, contributing my expertise to two distinct research teams. I actively participate in the entire cycle of research projects, which includes designing study methodologies, selecting appropriate statistical techniques, and interpreting complex data sets. 

Frequently used tools are R, Python and Excel. Most used packages are MASS, glmnet, tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly, shiny for R and sklearn, numpy, pandas for Python.

## Parkinson Disease

The research team, led by Professor [Ying Chang](https://www.haodf.com/doctor/238861/xinxi-jieshao.html) from the Department of Neurology at China-Japan Union Hospital, has major interest in [Parkinson Disease (PD)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8525-parkinsons-disease-an-overview). From August 2022, I have taken responsibilities in  experimental design, data processing, statistical analysis and visualization. 

As of `r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')`, the team has achieved significant advancements in researching the risk factors associated with non-motor symptoms in patients with PD. We have diligently worked to verify and quantify the relationships between various factors and the occurrence of specific symptoms, like apathy and [impulse control disorder](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25175-impulse-control-disorders) . Ultimately, our efforts have culminated in the development of a predictive model to forecast the onset of these symptoms in PD patients.

Another topic is about the correlation between cerebellar glucose metabolism and cognitive status in PD patients using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and we try to find underlying mechanisms.

## Bone and Joint Surgery

The research team, spearheaded by Professor [Xin Qi](https://m.haodf.com/doctor/78526.html) from the Department of Bone and Joint Surgery at the First Hospital of Jilin University, has made significant advancements in their field. Detailed demonstration of their results can be found on this [websit](https://enrouteallmylife.shinyapps.io/IndividualizedCupReplacement/) (a little shabby, still working on that). From September 2023, I have shoulder the majority of the analytical and coding responsibilities, including data management, processing, modeling, visualization and website construction.

So far by `r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')`, the team has achieved notable progress in the following areas:

### Total Hip Arthroplasty on Pelvic Mobility

This is a prospective cohort study focusing on the impacts of total hip [arthroplasty](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/arthroplasty) on pelvic mobility. The study centers are The First Hospital of Jilin University and The Sixth Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. The primary objectives of this study are threefold:

* To study changes of pelvic mobility after hip arthroplasty and associated influencing factors in patients with different diagnosis.

* To establish a prediction model for pelvic stiffness remission after hip replacement in patients with DDH.

* To establish a method to screen patients with possible abnormal pelvic mobility based on routine preoperative examinations.


### Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee Classification 

This is a retrospective cohort study focusing on the distribution of coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification among the [osteoarthritis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/arthritis/osteoarthritis) and the healthy population. Particularly focusing on Chinese population, the primary objectives of this study are threefold:

* To investigate the distribution of CPAK within the Chinese population; to determine if it aligns with previous study.

* To study the impact of OA progression on CPAK classification changes

* To establish a machine learning algorithm for predicting the phenotypic structure of osteoarthritic knee joints.
