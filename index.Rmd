Hi, I'm Ada, currently a first-year MS student in Biostatistics at Columbia University.

I'm an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and also a [Scorpio](https://www.zodiacsign.com/zodiac-signs/scorpio/). I don't really believe in condensing one's personality into few categories but still it is an easy way to learn oneself.

This year, I really wanna go to Mexico and visit [Museo Frida Kahlo](https://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/?lang=en). 

Winter in New York is killing me, I will definitely go hiking the minute Spring comes.

Also, [Harmony](https://harmonyanewmusical.com/), the musical is going to have the final performance on Feb 2024.Please go and see it!
