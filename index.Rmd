Hi, I'm Ada, currently a first-year MS student in Biostatistics at Columbia University.

I'm an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) and also a [Scorpio](https://www.zodiacsign.com/zodiac-signs/scorpio/).



This year, I really wanna go to Mexico and visit [Museo Frida Kahlo](https://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/?lang=en). 

Currently obsessed with Notion. I'm totally in the "Give a man a hammer & everything becomes a nail" state-of-mind.

Craving cuddles with furry friends. A cat lover and dogs are absolutely adorable, it just sometimes I might shed away from their boundless energy.
